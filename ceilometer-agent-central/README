This is a simple example to setup ceilometer-agent-central as a highly
available service with Corosync & Pacemaker. All is installed with Puppet, see
the manifest : puppet/manifests/site.pp

This example was tested on a Debian GNU/Linux Wheezy LXC container managed by
Vagrant with the vagrant-lxc plugin. If you wish to use Vagrant with
Virtualbox, you will need to add a host-only interface and change the
'$::network_eth0' variable to '$::network_eth1'.
